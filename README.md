# Regression Neural Network for e+e- invariant mass reconstruction
The aim of this project is to build a Shallow Neural Network model whose goal is to predict the invariant mass of e+e- pairs from the Kaggle dataset [CERN Electron Collision Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/cern-electron-collision-data) generated by the CMS collaboration using a simulation of pp collision during the preliminary studies for the LHC experiment.

This notebook was created as an exam project for the course [Machine Learning for Applied and High Energy Physics](https://www.fisicamagistrale.unito.it/do/corsi.pl/Show?_id=p2bf) at the University of Turin.
The main focus is not about the absolute performance but is a toy example used to test and improve skills about ML design.
